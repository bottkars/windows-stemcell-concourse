# Windows Stemcell Automation (air-gapped)

This branch of windows-stemcell-concourse is for concourse environments with no internet access. All needed assets must be manually brought within the network to be made available to the tasks. There is only a pipeline definiation and vars yaml in this branch, as it still uses the tasks from master.
